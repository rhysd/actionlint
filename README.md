actionlint
==========
[![CI Status][ci-badge]][ci]
[![API Document][apidoc-badge]][apidoc]

[actionlint][repo] is a static checker for GitHub Actions workflow files. [Try it online!][playground]

Features:

- **Syntax check for workflow files** to check unexpected or missing keys following [workflow syntax][syntax-doc]
- **Strong type check for `${{ }}` expressions** to catch several semantic errors like access to not existing property,
  type mismatches, ...
- **Actions usage check** to check that inputs at `with:` and outputs in `steps.{id}.outputs` are correct
- **Reusable workflow check** to check inputs/outputs/secrets of reusable workflows and workflow calls
- **[shellcheck][] and [pyflakes][] integrations** for scripts at `run:`
- **Security checks**; [script injection][script-injection-doc] by untrusted inputs, hard-coded credentials
- **Other several useful checks**; [glob syntax][filter-pattern-doc] validation, dependencies check for `needs:`,
  runner label validation, cron syntax validation, ...

See the [full list][checks] of checks done by actionlint.

**Example of broken workflow:**

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branch: main
    tags:
      - 'v\d+'
jobs:
  test:
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [macos-latest, linux-latest]
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    steps:
      - run: echo "Checking commit '${{ github.event.head_commit.message }}'"
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node_version: 18.x
      - uses: actions/cache@v4
        with:
          path: ~/.npm
          key: ${{ matrix.platform }}-node-${{ hashFiles('**/package-lock.json') }}
        if: ${{ github.repository.permissions.admin == true }}
      - run: npm install && npm test
```

**actionlint reports 7 errors:**

## Quick start

Install `actionlint` command by downloading [the released binary][releases] or by Homebrew or by `go install`. See
[the installation document][install] for more details like how to manage the command with several package managers
or run via Docker container.

```sh
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest
```

Basically all you need to do is run the `actionlint` command in your repository. actionlint automatically detects workflows and
checks errors. actionlint focuses on finding out mistakes. It tries to catch errors as much as possible and make false positives
as minimal as possible.

```sh
actionlint
```

Another option to try actionlint is [the online playground][playground]. Your browser can run actionlint through WebAssembly.

See [the usage document][usage] for more details.
