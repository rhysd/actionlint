directory in `$PATH`.

Prebuilt binaries are built at each release by CI for the following OS and arch:

- macOS (x86_64, arm64)
- Linux (i386, x86_64, arm32, arm64)
- Windows (i386, x86_64, arm64)
- FreeBSD (i386, x86_64)

## Download script

To install `actionlint` executable with one command, [the download script](../scripts/download-actionlint.bash) is available.
It downloads the latest version of actionlint (`actionlint.exe` on Windows and `actionlint` on other OSes) to the current
directory automatically. This is a recommended way if you install actionlint in some shell script.

```sh
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash)
```

When you need to install specific version of actionlint, please give the version to the 1st command line argument. The following
example installs v1.6.17.

```sh
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash) 1.6.17
```

This script downloads `actionlint` (or `actionlint.exe` on Windows) binary to the current working directory. When you need to put
the downloaded binary to some other directory, please give the directory path to the 2nd command line argument. The following
example installs the latest version to `/usr/bin`.

```sh
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rhysd/actionlint/main/scripts/download-actionlint.bash) latest /usr/bin
```

For the usage of actionlint on GitHub Actions, see [the usage document](usage.md#on-github-actions).

## Docker image

See [the usage document](./usage.md#docker) to know how to install and use an official actionlint Docker image.

## asdf

You can install actionlint with the [asdf version manager][asdf] using the [asdf-actionlint][asdf-plugin] plugin, which
automates the process of installing (and switching between) various versions of GitHub release binaries. With asdf already
installed, run these commands to install actionlint:

```bash
# Add actionlint plugin
asdf plugin add actionlint

# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all actionlint

# Install specific version
asdf install actionlint latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global actionlint latest
```

## Build from source

Recent [Go][] toolchain is necessary to build actionlint from source. Use Go 1.16 or later.

```sh
# Install the latest stable version
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint@latest

# Install the head of main branch
go install github.com/rhysd/actionlint/cmd/actionlint
```

If `GOPATH` is not on your shell `PATH` variable yet, you might want to add the value from `go env | grep GOPATH`.

Example `~/.bashrc`

```sh
export PATH=$HOME/go/bin:...
```
